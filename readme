Bucket Encryption Reporting
crypt_check.py checks all buckets that is has access to for compliance with the
policies described on
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-prevent-uploads-of-unencrypted-objects-to-amazon-s3/,
which deny uploading non-encrypted files. Additional checks could be performed and are documented
in the comments of the python script.

You must configure your aws cli environment with credentials. The script takes no command line arguments.
An example of using the script and its output showing the 3 possible outcomes of the check:

$ python3 crypt_check.py

bucket: cloudtrail-logs
In violation of encryption enforcement policy, insufficient policy statements

bucket: templates
In violation of encryption enforcement policy, no policy applied

bucket: customerbilling
Complies with encrytpion enforcement policy
